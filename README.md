- Hi, I’m @berteundamman, and I'm the CTO of [Collect Trading](https://www.collect-trading.com/)

We are a trading company for the digital assets market. We write fast code in C++, concurrent code in Go and UIs with TypeScript. Always looking for people with exceptional skills in one or more of these technologies. Especially if you like simple & straightforward code and love solving problems with technology rather than using technology for its own sake.

If you are interested, don't hesitate to contact us!
